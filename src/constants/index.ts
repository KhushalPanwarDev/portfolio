      "In my client-based projects, I leveraged React, TypeScript, and Ant Design to create robust and user-friendly web applications. A standout project was a collaborative workspace platform that showcased my ability to implement complex features. This application included a comprehensive user authentication system with signup and login functionalities, allowing users to create and manage workspaces and rooms. The platform's centerpiece was an interactive whiteboard, enabling real-time collaboration among team members. I also integrated a chat interface, facilitating instant communication within the workspace. Throughout the project, I focused on developing a cohesive and intuitive user interface to ensure a seamless user experience. In addition to this major project, I worked on several other client applications, where I designed and implemented user interfaces, developed custom features to meet specific client needs, and maintained a strong emphasis on creating responsive and accessible designs. These projects further honed my skills in React, TypeScript, Redux, scss, Tailwind css and Ant Design, allowing me to deliver high-quality, tailored solutions for each client.",
